# MIPT-OOP-C-course-tasks
Object oriented programming in C++

Both semesters I've had 4 modules of different tasks.

Each module is present in it's own folder. If some module is missing then I've just skipped it.

In each module folder you can find .cpp files with solution code and the task in .docx format.
